# Deloitte-Internship

In this project, I implemented two Python functions to convert different JSON formats to a common format, as per requirements. The data to be transformed represents device information, including its ID, type, timestamp, location, and operational status. The transformation involves handling nested objects, converting string locations into structured data, and changing timestamp formats. This code is useful for standardizing data formats in a system that receives device data from multiple sources or formats.
